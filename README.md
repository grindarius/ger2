## ger2

The successor of ger. It used to be my main repository for project that simulates a university registration program. I thought that project was not well designed from the first. So... Here I am creating yet another project just for fun!.

### Requirements

You need some things to properly run this project
- [docker](docker.com)
- [node v18](nodejs.org)
- [pnpm v8](pnpm.io)
- [rust v1.70](rustup.rs)
